### Student Info

A peaceful butterfly garden filled with pretty plants, butterflies and bees.

- Moving the mouse will scare away the butterflies and bees (but they will move around normally when the player is still?)
- Clicking on any agent destroys it

## Butterfly

Just having a good time amongst all the other butterflies

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** 

#### Steering Behaviors

- Wander, Stay In Bounds, Flock(separate, cohere, align) with other butterflies
- Obstacles - bees, user's mouse
- Seperation - bees (obstacle), other butterflies(to the best they can)
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_
   - _eg, When this agent has reached target of State2_
   
### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- Same as before:
- Wander, Stay In Bounds, Flock(separate, cohere, align) with other butterflies
- Obstacles - bees, user's mouse
- Seperation - bees (obstacle), other butterflies(to the best they can)
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_

## Bee

Just flying around and pollinating flowers

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- Wander, Stay In Bounds
- Obstacles - other bees (too busy working to socialize), user's mouse
- Seperation - other bees, butterflies
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   
### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- Same as before:
- Wander, Stay In Bounds
- Obstacles - other bees (too busy working to socialize), user's mouse

## Make it Your Own

- Made my own butterfly and bee sprite images, added background music

## Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_
- currently the bees sometimes manage to fly upside down
