### Student Info

-   Name: Judy Derrick
-   Section: 02

## Simulation Design

A peaceful butterfly garden filled with pretty plants, butterflies and maybe even some fairies if you're lucky.

### Controls
- Moving the mouse will scare away the butterflies, but they will move around normally when the player is still
- Clicking on any agent destroys it
- Clicking on the background will change the colors/theme of everything including the agents (ex. Day/Night)

## Butterfly

Just having a good time amongst the flowers and trying to be friends with the fairies
